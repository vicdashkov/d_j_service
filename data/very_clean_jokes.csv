She was a very good-looking woman and determined to keep the ranch, but knew very little about ranching, so she decided to place an ad in the newspaper for a ranch hand.  Two cowboys applied for the job. One was gay and the other a drunk. She thought long and hard about it, and when no one else applied she decided to hire the gay guy, figuring it would be safer to have him around the house than the drunk.  He proved to be a hard worker who put in long hours every day and knew a lot about ranching.  For weeks, the two of them worked, and the ranch was doing very well. Then one day, the rancher's widow said to the hired hand, ""You have done a really good job, and the ranch looks great. You should go into town and kick up your heels."" The hired hand readily agreed and went into town one Saturday night.  One o'clock came, however, and he didn't return.  Two o'clock and no hired hand.  Finally he returned a round two-thirty, and upon entering the room, he found the rancher's widow sitting by the fireplace with a glass of wine, waiting for him.  She quietly called him over to her..  ""Unbutton my blouse and take it off,"" she said.  Trembling, he did as she directed. ""Now take off my boots.""  He did as she asked, ever so slowly.. ""Now take off my socks.""  He removed each gently and placed them neatly by her boots.  ""Now take off my skirt.""  He slowly unbuttoned it, constantly watching her eyes in the fire light. ""Now take off my bra.."" Again, with trembling hands, he did as he was told and dropped it to the floor.  Then she looked at him and said, ""If you ever wear my clothes into town again, you're fired."""

""Well, yes, is that a problem?"" ""Oh no, no problem. But we've recently adopted a new system for people in your line of work, and unfortunately you will have to spend a day in Hell. After that however, you're free to choose where you want to spend eternity!""   ""Wait, I have to spend a day in Hell??"" says the politician. ""Them's the rules"" Says St Peter, clicks his fingers, and WOOMPH, the guy dissapears...  And awakes, curled up with his hands over his eyes, knowing he's in Hell. Cautiously, he listens for the screams, sniffs the air for brimstone, and finds... Nothing. Just the smell of, is that fabric softener? And cut grass, this can't be right?  ""Open your eyes!"" says a voice. ""C'mon, wakey wakey, we've only got 24 hours!"". Nervously, he uncovers his eyes, looks around, and sees he's in a hotel room. A nice one too. Wait, this is a penthouse suite... And there's a smiling man in a suit, holding a martini. ""Who are you??"" The politician asks. ""Well, I'm Satan!"" says the man, handing him the drink and helping him to his feet. ""Welcome to Hell!"" ""Wait, this is Hell? But... Where's all the pain and suffering?"" he asks. Satan throws him a wink. ""Oh, we've been a bit mis-represented over the years, it's a long story. Anyway, this is your room! The minibar is of course free, as is the room service, there's extra towels next to the hot-tub, and if you need anything, just call reception. But enough of this! It's a beautiful day, and if you'd care to look outside..."" Slightly stunned by the opulent surroundings, the man wanders over to the floor-to-ceiling windows through which the sun is glowing, looks far down, and sees a group of people cheering and waving at him from a golf course. ""It's one of 5 pro-level courses on site, and there's another 6 just a few minutes drive out past the beach and harbour!"" says Satan, answering his unasked question. So they head down in the lift, walk out through the glittering lobby where everyone waves and welcomes the man, as Satan signs autographs and cherrily talks shop with the laughing staff. And as he walks out, he sees the group on the golf course are made up of every one of his old friends, people he's admired for years but never met or worked with, and people whose work he's admired but died long before his career started. And out of the middle of this group walks his wife, with a massive smile and the body she had when she was 20, who throws her arms around him and plants a delicate kiss on his cheek. Everyone cheers and applauds, and as they slap him on the back and trade jokes, his worst enemy arrives, as a 2 foot tall goblin-esque caddy. He spends the day in the bright sunshine on the course, having the time of his life laughing at jokes and carrying important discussions, putting the world to rights with his friends while holding his delighted wife next to him as she gazes lovingly at him. Later, they return to the hotel for dinner and have an enormous meal, perfectly cooked, which descends into a food-fight when someone accidentally throws a bread roll at the next table (where Ghandi is having a game of truth-or-dare with Marylin Monroe). As everyone is falling about laughing and flinging breadsticks at each other, his wife whispers in his ear... And they return to their penthouse suite, and spend the rest of the night making love like they did on their honeymoon. After 6 hours of intense passion, the man falls deep into the 100% Egyptian cotton pillows, and falls into a deep and happy sleep...  And is woken up by St Peter. ""So, that was Hell. Wasn't what you were expecting, I bet?"" ""No sir!"" says the man. ""So then"" says St Peter ""you can make your choice. It's Hell, which you saw, or Heaven, which has choral singing, talking to God, white robes, and so on"". ""Well... I know this sounds strange, but on balance, I think I'd prefer Hell"" says the politician. ""Not a problem, we totally understand! Enjoy!"" Says St Peter, and clicks his fingers again.  The man wakes up in total darkness, the stench of ammonia filling the air and distant screams the only noise. As he adjusts, he can see the only light is from belches of flame far away, illuminating the ragged remains of people being tortured or burning in a sulphurous ocean. A sudden bolt of lightning reveals Satan next to him, wearing the same suit as before and grinning, holding a soldering iron in one hand and a coil of razor-wire in the other. ""What's this??"" He cries. ""Where's the hotel?? Where's my wife??? Where's the minibar, the golf-courses, the pool, the restaurant, the free drinks and the sunshine???""  ""Ah"", says Satan.

0,"My dad's favourite joke. Mine too.  There was  a scientist working away in obscurity for years with peculiar experiments on spiders. After years and years he placed an advertisement in several academic journals to let the community know he and was to host a live show to demonstrate his findings.  At the event hundreds were there more out of curiosity than anything as the details of the findings were kept secret. The man himself wandered on stage and silenced the murmurs.   'Today I will demonstrate two things. The first being that spiders can understand and respond to basic commands.'   The crowd laughed and jeered but undeterred he opened a box on his desk and a spider crawled out.   'Spider, walk left'  The spider moved to its left. The crowd was silenced.   'Spider, move right.'   The spider moved right. The crowd gasped. Forward, backward, the spider responded again and again. The crowd applauded in awe.   The scientist then removed all of the spider's legs. The crowd, confused by this, watched in silence.   'Move left'   The spider didn't move.  'Move right'   Nothing. Forward, backward, no response.   'This is to demonstrate my second finding. Once you remove a spider's legs, it goes deaf.' "

One day an acquaintance ran up to him excitedly and said, ""Socrates, do you know what I just heard about Diogenes?""  ""Wait a moment,"" Socrates replied, ""Before you tell me I'd like you to pass a little test. It's called the Triple Filter Test.""  ""Triple filter?"" asked the acquaintance.  ""That's right,"" Socrates continued, ""Before you talk to me about Diogenes let's take a moment to filter what you're going to say. The first filter is Truth. Have you made absolutely sure that what you are about to tell me is true?""  ""No,"" the man said, ""Actually I just heard about it.""  ""All right,"" said Socrates, ""So you don't really know if it's true or not. Now let's try the second filter, the filter of Goodness. Is what you are about to tell me about Diogenes something good?""  ""No, on the contrary...""  ""So,"" Socrates continued, ""You want to tell me something about Diogenes that may be bad, even though you're not certain it's true?""  The man shrugged, a little embarrassed. Socrates continued, ""You may still pass the test though, because there is a third filter, the filter of Usefulness. Is what you want to tell me about Diogenes going to be useful to me?""  ""No, not really.""  ""Well,"" concluded Socrates, ""If what you want to tell me is neither True nor Good nor even Useful, why tell it to me or anyone at all?""  The man was bewildered and ashamed. This is an example of why Socrates was a great philosopher and held in such high esteem.  It also explains why Socrates never found out that Diogenes was banging his wife."

Thought you might like to come at about 5:00...' 'Great', says Tom, 'after six months out here I'm ready to meet some local folks thank you.' As Cliff is leaving, he stops. 'Gotta warn you. Be some drinking'.'  'Not a problem' says Tom. 'After 25 years in the business, I can drink with the best of 'em'.  Again, the big man starts to leave and stops. 'More 'n' likely gonna be some fighting' too.'  'Well, I get along with people, I'll be all right! . I'll be there. Thanks again.'  'More'n likely be some wild sex, too,'  'Now that's really not a problem' says Tom, warming to the idea. 'I've been all alone for six months! I'll definitely be there.. By the way, what should I wear?'  'Don't much matter. Just gonna be the two of us."

0,"joke I heard a while ago, not sure if it's been posted (new to reddit) Once upon a time lived a beautiful Queen with large breasts. Nick the Dragon Slayer obsessed over the Queen for this reason. He knew that the penalty for his desire would be death should he try to touch them, but he had to try. One day Nick revealed his secret desire to his colleague, Horatio the Physician, the King's chief doctor. Horatio thought about this and said that he could arrange for Nick to more than satisfy his desire, but it would cost him 1 000 gold coins to arrange it. Without pause Nick readily agreed to the scheme.   The next day, Horatio made a batch of itching powder and poured a little bit into the Queen's bra while she bathed. Soon after she dressed, the itching commenced and grew intense. Upon being summoned to the Royal Chambers to address this incident, Horatio informed the King and Queen that only a special saliva, if applied for four hours, would cure this type of itch, and that tests had shown that only the saliva of Nick would work as the antidote to cure the itch. The King, eager to help his Queen, quickly summoned Nick to their chambers. Horatio then slipped Nick the antidote for the itching powder, which he put into his mouth, and for the next four hours, Nick worked passionately on the Queen's large and magnificent breasts. The Queen's itching was eventually relieved, and Nick left satisfied and hailed as a hero.   Upon returning to his chamber, Nick found Horatio demanding his payment of 1000 gold coins. With his obsession now satisfied, Nick couldn't have cared less knowing that Horatio could never report this matter to the King and with a laugh told him to get Lost. The next day, Horatio slipped a massive dose of the same itching powder into the kings underwear. The king immediately summoned Nick."

The bear looked at the fly, and thought to itself, ""If that fly would drop down about a half an inch, that salmon would jump up to catch it, and I could jump out, snag that salmon, and I'd have myself something to eat.""  Across the stream, up a steep slope, a hunter was hidden in the brush.

Hidden in the grass behind the hunter was a mouse.

A bit higher up the slope, on a jutting rock, sat a pussy cat.

0,"A tourist in London decides to skip his tour group and explore the city on his own.  He wanders around, seeing the sights, occasionally stopping at a quaint  British pub to soak up the local culture, chat with the locals, and have a few pints of stout.  After a while, he finds himself in a very nice neighborhood with big, stately residences...no pubs, no stores, no restaurants, and worst of all NO PUBLIC RESTROOMS.  He really, really has to go, after all those drinks. He finds a narrow side street, with high walls surrounding the adjacent buildings and decides to use the wall to solve his problem.  As he is unzipping, he is tapped on the shoulder by a London police officer, who says, ""I say, sir, you simply cannot do that here, you know.""  ""I'm very sorry, officer,"" replies the tourist, ""but I really, really have to go, and I just can't find a public restroom.""  ""Ah, yes,"" said the policeman.""Just follow me"". He leads the tourist down a back delivery alley to a gate, which he opens.  ""In there,"" points the policeman. ""Go ahead sir, anywhere you like.""  The fellow enters and finds himself in the most beautiful garden he has ever seen. Manicured grass lawns, statuary, fountains, sculptured hedges, and huge beds of gorgeous flowers, all in perfect bloom.  Since he has the policeman's blessing, he relieves himself and feels much more comfortable. As he goes back through the gate, he says to the police officer, ""That was really decent of you... is that what you call English hospitality?""  ""No sir,"" replied the police officer, ""that is what we call the French Embassy."""

If it weren't for pick-pocketers, I'd have no sex life at all.  Once when I was lost I saw a policeman and asked him to help me find my parents. I said to him, ""Do you think we'll ever find them?"" He said, ""I don't know kid. There are so many places they can hide.""  I remember I was so depressed I was going to jump out a window on the tenth floor. They sent a priest up to talk to me. He said, ""On your mark...""  When my old man wanted sex, my mother would show him a picture of me.  I had a lot of pimples too. One day I fell asleep in a library. I woke up and a blind man was reading my face.  My wife made me join a bridge club. I jump off next Tuesday.  Last week my tie caught on fire. Some guy tried to put it out with an ax!  I met the surgeon general. He offered me a cigarette.  I was making love to this girl and she started crying. I said, ""Are you going to hate yourself in the morning?"" She said, ""No, I hate myself now.""  I knew a girl so ugly that she was known as a two-bagger. That's when you put a bag over your head in case the bag over her head breaks.  I knew a girl so ugly, they use her in prisons to cure sex offenders.  I knew a girl so ugly, I took her to the top of the Empire State building and planes started to attack her.  I knew a girl so ugly, the last time I saw a mouth like hers it had a hook on the end of it.  I knew a girl so ugly, she had a face like a saint--a Saint Bernard!  I was tired one night and I went to the bar to have a few drinks. The bartender asked me, ""What'll you have?"" I said, ""Surprise me."" He showed me a naked picture of my wife.  During sex my wife always wants to talk to me. Just the other night she called me from a hotel.  My marriage is on the rocks again. Yeah, my wife just broke up with her boyfriend.  One day as I came home early from work, I saw a guy jogging naked. I said to the guy, ""Hey buddy...why are you doing that for?"" He said, ""Because you came home early.""  I went to see my doctor... Doctor Vidi-boom-ba. Yeah...I told him once, ""Doctor, every morning when I get up and look in the mirror I feel like throwing up. What's wrong with me? He said, ""I don't know, but your eyesight is perfect.""  I told my dentist my teeth are going yellow. He told me to wear a brown necktie.  My psychiatrist told me I'm going crazy. I told him, ""If you don't mind, I'd like a second opinion."" He said, ""All right. You're ugly too!""  I was so ugly, my mother used to feed me with a slingshot!  When I was born the doctor took one look at my face, turned me over and said, ""Look, twins!""  And we were poor too. Why, if I wasn't born a boy, I'd have nothing to play with!  With my wife I don't get no respect. I made a toast on her birthday to 'the best woman a man ever had.' The waiter joined me.  I'm not a sexy guy. I went to a hooker. I dropped my pants. She dropped her price.  I tell you, I'm not a sexy guy. I was the centerfold for Playgirl magazine. The staples covered everything!  What a childhood I had, why, when I took my first step, my old man tripped me!  Last week I told my psychiatrist, ""I keep thinking about suicide."" He told me from now on I have to pay in advance.  I tell ya when I was a kid, all I knew was rejection. My yo-yo, it never came back!   Oh, when I was a kid in show business I was poor. I used to go to orgies to eat the grapes.  When I was a kid I got no respect. The time I was kidnapped, and the kidnappers sent my parents a note they said, ""We want five thousand dollars or you'll see your kid again.""  I tell ya, my wife was never nice. On our first date, I asked her if I could give her a goodnight kiss on the cheek - she bent over!  I tell you, with my doctor, I don't get no respect. I told him, ""I've swallowed a bottle of sleeping pills."" He told me to have a few drinks and get some rest.   Some dog I got too. We call him Egypt because he leaves a pyramid in every room.  With my dog I don't get no respect. He keeps barking at the front door. He don't want to go out. He wants me to leave.  What a dog I got. His favorite bone is in my arm!  Last week I saw my psychiatrist. I told him, ""Doc, I keep thinking I'm a dog."" He told me to get off his couch.  I worked in a pet store and people kept asking how big I'd get."
0,"An Amish joke.  An Amish boy and his father were visiting a mall. They were amazed by almost everything they saw, but especially by two shiny, silver walls that could move apart and back together again.  The boy asked his father, ""What is this father?"" The father (never having seen an elevator) responded, ""Son, I have never seen anything like this in my life, I don't know what it is.""  While the boy and his father were watching wide-eyed, an old lady limping slightly with a cane slowly walks up to the moving walls and pressed a button. The walls opened and the lady walks between them and into a small room. The walls closed and the boy and his father watched, small circles of light with numbers above the wall light up.  They continued to watch the circles light up in the reverse direction.  The walls opened up again and a beautiful 24-year-old woman stepped out.  The father said to his son, ""Go get your Mother."""
0,"A cowboy... ... walks into a bar in Texas and orders three beers. He sits at the bar, drinking a sip out of each glass in turn.  This goes on for a few weeks till the bartender says "" You know beer goes flat after pouring - why don't you just buy them one at a time?""   The cowboy replies, ""Well, you see, I have two brothers. One is in Arizona, the other is in Colorado . When they left our home we promised that we'd drink this way to remember the days when we drank together. So I'm drinking one beer for each of my brothers and one for myself."" The bartender admits that this is a nice custom, and leaves it there.  The cowboy becomes a regular in the bar, and always drinks the same way.   One day, he comes in and only orders two beers. All the regulars take notice and fall silent. When he comes back to the bar for the second round, the bartender says, ""I don't want to intrude on your grief, but I wanted to offer my condolences on your loss.""  The cowboy looks quite puzzled for a moment, then a light dawns in his eyes and he laughs. ""Oh, no, everybody's just fine,"" he explains, ""It's just that my  wife made me quit drinking but it hasn't affected my brothers though."""

Daddy was in the living room engrossed in the evening news when I brought Daddy a little cup of ‘tea’, which was just water.

0,"A good bar joke that always makes women laugh Jack woke up with a huge hangover after attending his company's Christmas party. He didn't even remember how he got home from the party.   As bad as he as feeling, he wondered if he did something wrong.  Jack had to force himself to open his eyes, and the first thing he saw was couple of aspirins next to a glass of water on the side table.  And, next to them, a single red rose! Jack sat up and saw his clothing in front of him, all clean and pressed.   He looked around the room and saw that it was in perfect order, spotlessly clean.   So was the rest of the house. He took the aspirins, and cringed when he saw a huge black eye staring back at him in the bathroom mirror.  Then he noticed a note hanging on the corner of the mirror written in red with little hearts on it and a kiss mark from his wife in lipstick:   ""Honey, breakfast is on the stove. I left early to get groceries to make you your favorite dinner tonight. I love you, darling!""  He stumbled to the kitchen and sure enough, there was hot breakfast, steaming hot coffee and the morning newspaper. His son was also at the table, eating.   Jack asked, ""Son, what happened last night?""  ""Well, you came home after 3 A.M, drunk and out of your mind. You fell over the coffee table and broke it, and then you puked in the hallway,  and got that black eye when you ran into the door.""  Confused, he asked his son, ""So, why is everything in such perfect order and so clean? I have a rose, and breakfast is on the table waiting for me??  His son replied, ""Oh THAT! Mum dragged you to the bathroom to clean you up, and when she tried to take your pants off, you screamed, 'Leave me alone bitch, I'm married!"" "
0,"Why I fired my secretary today.    Last week was my birthday and I didn't feel very well waking up that morning. I went downstairs for breakfast hoping my wife would be pleasant and say, ""Happy birthday!"", and possibly have a present for me.  As it turned out, she barely said good morning, let alone ""Happy birthday"".  I thought... well, that's marriage for you, but the kids will remember. My kids ate breakfast and didn't say a word.  So when I left for the office, I was feeling pretty low and somewhat despondent.   As I walked into my office, my secretary, Jane said, ""Good morning boss, happy birthday!"" It felt a little better that at least someone had remembered.  I worked until one o'clock and then Jane knocked on my door and said, ""You know,it's such a beautiful day outside, and it's your birthday, let's go out to lunch, just you and me"".  I said, ""Thanks Jane, that's the greatest thing I've heard all day. Let's go!  ""We went to lunch. But we didn't go where we normally would go. We dined instead at a little place with a private table. We had two martinis each and I enjoyed the meal tremendously.  On the way back to the office, Jane said, ""You know, it's such a beautiful day...We don't need to go back to the office, do we?""  I responded, ""I guess not. What do you have in mind?""  She said, ""Let's go to my apartment"".  After arriving at her apartment Jane turned to me and said, ""Boss, if you don't mind, I'm going to step into the bedroom for a moment. I'll be right back"".  ""OK"", I nervously replied.

0,"A rapist and a con artist get caught... A rapist and con artist get caught by the sheriff in a small town.  The town doesn’t have much money to take care of prisoners so the sheriff gets an idea.  He decides he’ll charge money to let the townspeople punish the crooks and use the money to keep them in jail for as long as he can.  The sheriff figures  even a short stay in jail will be plenty after a little “justice” from the townspeople.  The sheriff takes the criminals to the town square, handcuffs them posts and sets up shop.  He tells the people that the punishment should fit the crime so anyone can pay $1 to kick the rapist in the groin.  Since the con artist used his image to wrong his victims, anyone can pay $1 to hit him in the face.  After a while there are two long lines for the criminals.  Some people paying $5, $10, even $15 to get their licks in.  After a long while, a guy steps up for his turn and sees the con artist’s face is a bloody pulp and thinks “He’s so beat up at this point, he probably can’t even feel anything anymore.  I’m not going to waste my money on that.”  So the guy walks up and kicks the con artist squarely in the groin.  The sheriff sees this and hurries over and says, “Hey son, you can’t do that here.”   The man asks, “Why not?”  And the sheriff replies, “Because this is the punch line.”"

Early one morning, the woman awoke, and while looking out of the window onto to the pasture, she saw that the family's only cow waslying dead in the field.  The situation looked hopeless to her -- how could she possibly continue to feed her family now?  In a depressed state of mind, she hung herself.  When the man awoke to find his wife dead, as well as the cow, he too began to see the hopelessness of the situation, and he shot himself in the head.  Now the oldest son woke up to discover his parents dead (and the cow!), and he decided to go down to the river and drown himself.  When he got to the river, he discovered a mermaid sitting on the bank.  She said, ""I've seen all and know the reason for your despair.  But if you will have sex with me five times in a row, I will restore your parents and the cow to you."" The son agreed to try, but after four times, he was simply unable to satisfy her again.  So the mermaid drowned him in the river.  Next the second oldest son woke up.  After discovering what had happened, he too decided to throw himself into the river.  The mermaid said to him, ""If you will have sex with me ten times in a row, I will make everything right."" And while the son tried his best (seven times!), it was not enough to satisfy the mermaid, so she drowned him in the river.  The youngest son woke up and saw his parents dead, the dead cow in the field, and his brothers gone.  He decided that life was a hopeless prospect, and he went down to the river to throw himself in.  And there he also met the mermaid.  ""I have seen all that has happened, and I can make everything right if you will only have sex with me fifteen times in a row."" The young son replied, ""Is that all?  Why not twenty times in a row?"" The mermaid was somewhat taken aback by this request.  Then he said, ""Hell, why not twenty-five times in a row?"" And even as she was reluctantly agreeing to his request, he said, ""Why not THIRTY times in a row?""  Finally, she said, ""Enough!!  Okay, if you will have sex with me thirty times in a row, then I will bring everybody back to perfect health."" Then the young son asked, ""Wait!

0,"A bit dated, but it gave me a chuckle nonetheless. (Blatantly stolen from a grandma email.) A cowboy named Bud was overseeing his herd in a remote mountainous pasture in Montana when suddenly a brand-new BMW advanced toward him out of a cloud of dust.  The driver, a young man in a Brioni suit, Gucci shoes, RayBan sunglasses and YSL tie, leaned out the window and asked the cowboy, ""If I tell you exactly how many cows and calves you have in your herd, will you give me a calf?""  Bud looks at the man, who obviously is a yuppie, then looks at his peacefully grazing herd and calmly answers, ""Sure, why not?""  The yuppie parks his car, whips out his Dell notebook computer, connects it to his Cingular RAZR V3 cell phone, and surfs to a NASA page on the Internet, where he calls up a GPS satellite to get an exact fix on his location which he then feeds to another NASA satellite that scans the area in an ultra-high-resolution photo.  The young man then opens the digital photo in Adobe Photoshop and exports it to an image processing facility in Hamburg, Germany ...  Within seconds, he receives an email on his Palm Pilot that the image has been processed and the data stored. He then accesses an MS-SQL database through an ODBC connected Excel spreadsheet with email on his Blackberry and, after a few minutes, receives a response.  Finally, he prints out a full-color, 150-page report on his hi-tech, miniaturized HP LaserJet printer, turns to the cowboy and says, ""You have exactly 1,586 cows and calves.""  ""That's right. Well, I guess you can take one of my calves,"" says Bud.  He watches the young man select one of the animals and looks on with amusement as the young man stuffs it into the trunk of his car.  Then Bud says to the young man, ""Hey, if I can tell you exactly what your business is, will you give me back my calf?""  The young man thinks about it for a second and then says, ""Okay, why not?""  ""You're a Congressman for the U.S. Government"", says Bud.  ""Wow! That's correct,"" says the yuppie, ""but how did you guess that?""  ""No guessing required."" answered the cowboy. ""You showed up here even though nobody called you; you want to get paid for an answer I already knew, to a question I never asked. You used millions of dollars worth of equipment trying to show me how much smarter than me you are; and you don't know a thing about how working people make a living - or about cows, for that matter.

0,"Found in my Physics text book. A man lives in a foreign country, and his job is to operate the train that connects one town to another. He is not very good at his job, and he is also very greedy. Since his income does not meet his expenses, he decides to steal from his passengers' fares. At first he steals only a little. However, as he gets more and more greedy, he steals more and more. Eventually, he is caught. The company is furious. Once he has been tried and found guilty, the company asks for the death penalty. The court refuses choosing to banish him from the country instead.   The man moves on to another country, certain that he can dedicate himself to a new life. However the only thing he really understands is operating trains, so before long, he is a train operater in this new country. Unfortunately, the old habits come back, and after a while, he starts stealing from the passengers' fairs again. Once again, he is eventually caught and taken back to trial. Once he is found guilty, the judge says he sees no hope for reform, since this is the second time the man has been caught doing this. Thus, the judge sentences the man to death.   On the day of execution, the man is placed in the electric chair, and the chair is turned on. Much to the surprise of everyone there, the man is not even hurt. He just sits there, as if nothing is happening. The instrument panel says that the electric chair is working, but the man is completely unaffected! The chair is turned off and on several more times, but the man doesn't even flinch! Finally, one of the guards asks the man why the electric chair isn't hurting him, and the man replies, ""Well, I've always been a really poor conductor.""."

After a complete exam the doctor told the man that the muscles around the base of his penis were damaged from a prior viral infection and there was nothing he could do for him.

The Bishop replied, ""When I am worried about getting nervous on the pulpit, I put a glass of vodka next to the water glass. If I start to get nervous, I take a sip.""  So next Sunday the priest took the Bishop's advice. At the beginning of the sermon, he got nervous and took a drink. He then proceeded to talk up a storm.

0,"The Frog I was playing golf, and even though I am usually a pretty good player, I was playing horribly that day. As I was about to tee off at the fourth hole I heard a voice say, three wood. I looked around and no one was behind me so I took my stance. Then once again I heard ..three wood. I looked down and there was a frog at the corner of the tee box, and he was telling me to use my three wood. I thought it was stupid but I was playing so badly that I thought nothing could hurt me so I took out my three wood. It was a long par four, and I hit the ball straight 250 yards with that three wood. Since the frog seemed to be lucky I picked him up and took him along with me. At the next hole he told me to use my five iron. It was a par three and I got my first hole in one ever. I made a least a birdie on all the rest of the holes, and all I had to do was listen to that frog.  That night I took the frog to the casino in my hotel. We played Roulette. I put my money where the frog said and won on every spin of the wheel. After that I was tired so I went up to bed. I took the frog out of my pocket and put it on the dresser. Suddenly it looked at me and said, kiss me. Now I wasn't about to kiss a frog, but he said it again. So I kissed the frog and he turned into the most beautiful fourteen year old girl you have ever seen in your entire life. And that your honor is how that fourteen year old girl ended up in my hotel room.  Edit 1: It's ok, I fixed my spelling error! Threat neutralized!"

All was well at first until Maggie took delivery of a 'woman's magazine and began to read things about sex. It soon became clear that she had never climaxed during sex and, according to her Grandmother, all Irish women are entitled to a climax once in a while.  To resolve the problem, Paddy and Maggie went to see the Veterinarian since there was no doctor within thirty miles who could be relied upon not to gossip. However, the Vet didn't have a clue about people. But he did recall during hot summers, his mother and father would fan a cow that was having difficulty breeding with a big towel.  Apparently, this cooled her down and helped her to relax. So he recommended they hire a strong, young man to wave a big towel over them while they were having sex. This, the Vet said, should cause the young wife to cool down, relax and possibly achieve the sought after climax.  So the couple hired a strong young man from Dublin to wave a huge bath towel over them as the Vet suggested. After many efforts, Maggie still had not climaxed so they went back to the Vet who suggested she change partners and let the young man have a go while Paddy waved the big towel.  They tried it that night and Maggie went into wild, screaming, ear-splitting climaxes, one right after the other for about two and a half hours.  When it was over, Paddy looked down at the exhausted young man and said loudly: ""And dat, me auld son, is how ya wave a feckin' towel!"""

The very next day I opted to take the day off of work to spend time with her. We went out to a nice lunch and then went shopping at a big, big unnamed department store. I walked around with her while she tried on several different very expensive outfits. She couldn’t decide which one to take so I told her we’d just buy them all. She wanted new shoes to compliment her new clothes, so I said lets get a pair for each outfit. We went onto the jewelry department where she picked out a pair of diamond earrings. Let me tell you…she was so excited. She must have thought I was one wave short of a shipwreck. I started to think she was testing me because she asked for a tennis bracelet when she doesn’t even know how to play tennis. I think I threw her for a loop when I said, “That’s fine, honey”. She was almost nearing sexual satisfaction from all of the excitement. Smiling with excited anticipation she finally said, “I think this is all dear, let’s go to the cashier”.  I could hardly contain myself when I blurted out, “No honey, I don’t feel like it”.  Her face just went completely blank as her jaw dropped with a baffled ""WHAT?”.  I then said “honey! I just want you to HOLD this stuff for a while. You’re just not in touch with my financial needs as a man enough for me to satisfy your shopping needs as a woman.” And just when she had this look like she was going to kill me, I added, “Why can’t you just love me for who I am and not for the things I buy you?”.  Apparently I’m not having sex tonight either."

0,"Use Your Lifeline A contestant on Who Wants to be a Millionaire? had reached the final plateau. And as she suspected it would be, the million-dollar question was no pushover. It was, ""Which of the following species of birds does not build its own nest, but instead lays its eggs in the nests of other birds? Is it A) the condor; B) the buzzard; C) the cuckoo; or D) the vulture?""   She did not know the answer. And she was doubly on the spot because she had used up her 50/50 Lifeline and her Audience Poll Lifeline. All that remained was her Phone-a-Friend Lifeline, and the woman had hoped against hope that she would not have to use it. Mainly because the only friend that she knew would be home happened to be a blonde.   But the contestant had no alternative. She called her friend and gave her the question and the four choices. The blonde responded unhesitatingly: ""That's easy. The answer is 'C' -- the cuckoo.""  The contestant had to make a decision and make it fast. She considered employing a reverse strategy and giving Regis any answer except the one that her friend had given her. And considering that her friend was a blonde, that would seem to be the logical thing to do.   On the other hand, the blonde had responded with such confidence, such certitude, that the contestant could not help but be persuaded.   Time was up. ""I need an answer,"" said Regis.   Crossing her fingers, the contestant said, ""C) the cuckoo.""   ""Is that your final answer?"" asked Regis.   ""Yes, that is my final answer,"" she said, breaking into a sweat.   After the usual foot-dragging delay Regis said, ""I regret to inform you that that answer is ... absolutely correct. You are now a millionaire!""   Three days later, the contestant hosted a party for her family and friends, including the blonde who had helped her win the million dollars.   ""Jenny, I just do not know how to thank you,"" said the contestant. ""Because of your knowing the answer to that final question, I am now a millionaire. And do you want to know something? It was the assuredness with which you answered the question that convinced me to go with your choice.""   ""You're welcome!"" the blonde said.   ""By the way,"" the winner said, not being able to contain the question anymore. ""How did you happen to know the right answer?""   ""Oh, come on,"" said the blonde.

He knew that the penalty for his desire would be death should he try to touch them, but he had to try. One day Nick revealed his secret desire to his colleague, Horatio the Physician, the King's chief doctor. Horatio thought about this and said that he could arrange for Nick to more than satisfy his desire, but it would cost him 1000 gold coins to arrange it.        Without pause, Nick readily agreed to the scheme.  The next day, Horatio made a batch of itching powder and poured a little bit into the Queen's bra while she bathed. Soon after she dressed, the itching commenced and grew intense. Upon being summoned to the Royal Chambers to address this incident, Horatio informed the King and Queen that only a special saliva, if applied for four hours, would cure this type of itch, and that tests had shown that, among all of the citizens of the kingdom,   only the saliva of Nick would work as the antidote to cure the itch.  The King, eager to help his Queen, quickly summoned Nick to their chambers. Horatio then slipped Nick the antidote for the itching powder, which he put into his mouth, and for the next four hours, Nick worked passionately on the Queen's large and magnificent breasts.

Jane pulls out a condom, cuts off the end, puts it over her cigarette, and continues smoking.  Arlene: What s that?  Jane: A condom. This way my cigarette doesn't get wet.  Arlene: Where did you get it?  Jane: You can get them at any pharmacy.  The next day, Arlene hobbles herself into the local pharmacy and announces to the pharmacist that she wants a box of condoms.  The pharmacist, obviously embarrassed, looks at her kind of strangely (she is, after all, over 80 years of age), but very delicately asks what brand of condom she prefers.  'Doesn't matter Sonny, as long as it fits on a Camel.'  The pharmacist fainted."

0,"10 men are about to become priests 10 men went to learn the way of priesthood. They have passed all tests and are going to go through the rite or ordination.  But before, they must pass a last test is to see if they are truly ready to serve the Lord.  All 10 are made to sit in line, naked, with a small bell tied to their penis. Then beautiful women, also naked, are made to pass in front of the priests. If the latter have all cast aside their human temptations, no bell should ring.  As the ladies walked by, trying to seduce the men, none but 1 bell started to ring. It rang louder and louder, until it slipped and fell down.  Ashamed, the should-be priest stood up to recover his bell. As he bent down to pick it up, 9 bells started to ring."

Upon making several false alarm trips to the bathroom, he decided the latest episode was another and stayed put.  He suddenly filled his bed with diarrhea and was embarrassed beyond his ability to remain rational.  In a complete loss of composure he jumped out of bed, gathered up the bed sheets, and threw them out the hospital window.  A drunk was walking by the hospital when the sheets landed on him.  He started yelling, cursing, and swinging his arms violently trying to get the unknown things off, and ended up with the soiled sheets in a tangled pile at his feet.  As the drunk stood there, unsteady on his feet, staring down at the sheets, a hospital security guard, (barely containing his laughter), and who had watched the whole incident, walked up and asked, ""What the heck is going on here?""  The drunk, still staring down replied: ""I think I just beat the shit out of a ghost."""

Just as they reached the first tee, a beautiful young blond woman carrying her bag of clubs approached them.  She explained that the member who brought her to the club for a round of golf had an emergency that called him away and asked the trio whether she could join them.  Naturally, the guys all agreed.  Smiling, the blonde thanked them and said, 'Look, fellows, I work in a topless bar as a dancer, so nothing shocks me anymore. If any of you want to smoke cigars, have a beer, bet, swear, tell off-color stories or do anything that you normally do when playing a round together, go ahead. But, I enjoy playing golf, consider myself pretty good at it, so don't try to coach me on how to play my shots.'  With that the guys agreed to relax and invited her to drive first.  All eyes were fastened on her shapely behind as she bent to place her ball on the tee. She then took her driver and hit the ball 270 yards down the middle, right in front of the green.  The father's mouth was agape. 'That was beautiful,' he said.  The blonde put her driver away and said, 'I really didn't get into it, and I faded it a little.'  After the three guys hit their drives and their second shots, the blonde took out an eight iron and lofted the ball within five feet of the hole. (She was closest to the pin.)  The son said, 'Damn, lady, you played that perfectly.'  The blonde frowned and said, 'It was a little weak, but even an easy seven would have been too much club. I've left a tricky little putt.' She then tapped in the five-footer for a birdie.  Having the honors, she drove first on the second hole, knocked the heck out of the ball, and it landed nearly 300 yards away smack in the middle of the fairway.  For the rest of the round the statuesque blonde continued to amaze the guys, quietly and methodically shooting for par or less on every hole.  When they arrived at the 18th green, the blond was three under par, and had a very nasty  12-foot putt on an undulating green for a par.  She turned to the three guys and said, 'I really want to thank you all for not acting like a bunch of chauvinists and telling me what club to use or how to play a shot, but I need this putt for a 69 and I'd really like to break 70 on this course.  If any one of you can tell me how to make par on this hole I'll take him back to my apartment, pour some 35-year-old Single Malt Strath Mill Scotch in him, fix him a steak dinner and then show him a very good time the rest of the night.'  The yuppie son jumped at the thought! He strolled across the green, carefully eyeing the line of the putt and finally said, 'Honey, aim about 6 inches to the right of the hole and hit it firm. It will get over that little hump and break right into the cup.'  The father knelt down and sighted the putt using his putter as a plumb. 'Don't listen to the kid, darlin', you want to hit it softly 10 inches to the right and let it run left down that little hogback, so it falls into the cup.'  The old gray-haired grandfather walked over to the blonde's ball, picked it up and handed it to her and said, 'That's a gimme, sweetheart.' The blonde smiled and said, 'Your car or mine?'"

0,"Baby Confusion An English, a Pakistani, and an Irish couple all simultaneously arrive at a hospital, all of the wives in the couple going into labour at approximately the same time. All of the babies were delivered healthily after fairly routine births but unfortunately, after placing the babies in their cradles, the nurse realized that she had forgotten to place tags on the different sheets. She informed the doctor of her mistake and that she was unable to recall which baby was which. The doctor was something of a scientist and believed that there was a parenting instinct which would allow them to identify the babies. He said they would let the couples go in, look at the babies, and take whichever one they identified as their own through this inherent, natural drive.  The English couple went first, returning almost immediately carrying the darkest skinned child. The nurse, recognizing this, approached the English couple to inform them;.  ""Sir, no offence, but I believe that this child belongs to that Pakistani couple over there""  ""Yeah, I know mate, but I heard that the other couple over there is Irish and I'm not taking any chances"""

I hadn't driven more than a mile down the road when the engine conked out and the car shuddered to a halt. I walked back home to get my husband's help.  When I got home I couldn't believe my eyes. He was in our bedroom with the neighbours daughter. I am 32, my husband is 34, and the neighbours daughter is 22. We have been married for ten years. When I confronted him, he broke down and admitted that they had been having an affair for the past  six months.  I told him to stop or I would leave him. He was sacked from his job six months ago and he says he has been feeling increasingly depressed and worthless. I love him very much, but ever since I gave him the ultimatum he has become increasingly distant. He won't go to counselling and I'm afraid I can't get through to him anymore.  Can you please help?  Sincerely, Sheila  -------------------------------   Dear Sheila:  A car stalling after being driven a short distance can be caused by a variety of faults with the engine. Start by checking that there is no dirt in the fuel line. If it is clear, check the vacuum pipes and hoses on the intake manifold and also check all grounding wires. If none of these approaches solves the problem, it could be that the fuel pump itself is faulty, causing low delivery pressure to the injectors.  I hope this helps.   Walter."

Well, she's not exactly my girlfriend, yet.  Went for my routine checkup today and everything seemed to be going fine until he stuck his index finger up my ass.

I was explaining to my wife last night that when you die you get reincarnated but must come back as a different creature. She said she would like to come back as a cow. I said, ""You're obviously not listening.""  At the Senior Citizens Center they had a contest the other day. I lost, but the questions were tricky. One question was: Where do women mostly have curly hair? Apparently the correct answer was Africa. Another question that I missed was to name one thing commonly found in cells. It appears that Mexicans is not the correct answer either.  There's a new Muslim clothing shop opened in our shopping center, but I've been banned from it after asking to look at some of the new bomber jackets.

Finally, at the insistence of a family friend, they decided to enroll their son in a private Catholic school.   After the first day, the boy's parents were surprised when he walked in after school with a stern, focused and very determined expression on his face, and went right past them straight to his room, where he quietly closed the door.

The worker nods and says he probably could. Putin, now becoming exasperated, asks: ""What if you'd had *three* bottles?""  The worker replies, ""I'm here, aren't I?"""

0,"How To Get Hired At Walmart   A manager at Wal-Mart had the task of hiring someone to fill a job opening. After sorting through a stack of resumes he found four people who were equally qualified. He decided to call the four in and ask them only one question. Their answer would determine which of them would get the job.  The day came and as the four sat around the conference room table, the interviewer asked, 'What is the fastest thing you know of?'  The first man replied, 'A THOUGHT.' It just pops into your head. There's no warning.  'That's very good!' replied the interviewer. 'And, now you sir?', he asked the second man.  'Hmmm...let me see 'A blink! It comes and goes and you don't know that it ever happened. A BLINK is the fastest thing I know of.'  'Excellent!' said the interviewer. 'The blink of an eye, that's a very popular cliché for speed.' He then turned to the third man, who was contemplating his reply.  'Well, out at my dad's ranch, you step out of the house and on the wall there's a light switch. When you flip that switch, way out across the pasture the light on the barn comes on in less than an instant. 'Yep, TURNING ON A LIGHT is the fastest thing I can think of'.  The interviewer was very impressed with the third answer and thought he had found his man. 'It's hard to beat the speed of light,' he said.  Turning to BUBBA, the fourth and final man, the interviewer posed the same question.  Old Bubba replied, 'After hearing the previous three answers, it's obvious to me that the fastest thing known is DIARRHEA.'  'WHAT!?' said the interviewer, stunned by the response.  'Oh sure', said BUBBA. 'You see, the other day I wasn't feeling so good, and I ran for the bathroom, but before I could THINK, BLINK, or TURN ON THE LIGHT, I had already s**t my pants.'  BUBBA is now the new greeter at a Wal-Mart near you! "

0,"When Engineers go to hell... An engineer dies and reports to the Pearly Gates. Saint Peter checks his dossier and, not seeing his name there, accidentally sends him to Hell. It doesn’t take long before the engineer becomes rather dissatisfied with the level of comfort in Hell. He soon begins to design and build improvements. Shortly thereafter, Hell has air conditioning, flush toilets and escalators. Needless to say, the engineer is a pretty popular guy. One day, God calls Satan and says with a sneer: ""So, how are things in Hell?"" Satan replies: ""Hey, things are going great. We’ve got air conditioning, flush toilets, and escalators. And there’s no telling what this engineer is going to come up with next."" ""What!"" God exclaims: ""You’ve got an engineer? That’s a mistake -- he should never have been sent to Hell... send him to me."" ""Not a chance,"" Satan replies: ""I like having an engineer on the staff, and I’m keeping him!"" God insists: ""Send him back or I’ll sue."" Satan laughs uproariously and answers: ""Yeah, right. And where are you going to get a lawyer?"""

With the conversation flowing, we got to her house fairly quick.   She thanked me, went to get out of the car, stopped for a moment, looked at me and whispered, ""How the hell did you know where I lived?"""

Airman Jones was assigned to the induction center, where he advised new recruits about their government benefits, especially their GI insurance.   It wasn't long before Captain Smith noticed that Airman Jones had almost a 100% record for insurance sales, which had never happened before.   Rather than ask about this, the Captain stood in the back of the room and listened to Jones's sales pitch.   Jones explained the basics of the GI Insurance to the new recruits, and then said: ""If you have GI Insurance and go into battle and are killed, the government has to pay $200,000 to your beneficiaries.   If you don't have GI insurance, and you go into battle and get killed, the government only has to pay a maximum of $6000.""

Mr. Putin hung up and started laughing with his aides about how those stupid Americans will fall for anything.   George hung up and called the President of a condom company. ""I need a favor, you've got to send 1,000,000 condoms right away over to Russia.""   ""Consider it done,"" said the president of the condom company.   ""Great!

So the boy asked the stewardess, ""If big dogs have baby dogs and big cats have baby cats, why don't big planes have baby planes?""

When he arrived at the first house on his route he was greeted by the whole family there, who congratulated him and sent him on his way with a big gift envelope. At the second house they presented him with a box of fine cigars. The folks at the third house handed him a selection of terrific fishing lures.   At the fourth house he was met at the door by a strikingly beautiful woman in a revealing negligee. She took him by the hand, gently led him through the door (which she closed behind him), and led him up the stairs to the bedroom where she blew his mind with the most passionate love he had ever experienced. When he had had enough they went downstairs, where she fixed him a giant breakfast: eggs, potatoes, ham, sausage, blueberry waffles, and fresh-squeezed orange juice. When he was truly satisfied she poured him a cup of steaming coffee. As she was pouring, he noticed a dollar bill sticking out from under the cup's bottom edge.   ""All this was just too wonderful for words,"" he said, ""but what's the dollar for?"" ""Well,"" she said, ""last night, I told my husband that today would be your last day, and that we should do something special for you. I asked him what to give you.""

He thought a minute and then said, ""You know, I may have a solution to this problem. I have two male parrots whom I have taught to pray and read the Bible. Bring your two parrots over to my house and we will put them in the cage with Francis and Job. My parrots can teach your parrots to praise and worship. I'm sure your parrots will stop saying that...that phrase in no time.""   ""Thank you,"" the lady responded, ""this may very well be the solution.""   The next day, she brought her female parrots to the priest's house. As he ushered her in, she saw his two male parrots were inside their cage, holding their rosary beads and praying. Impressed, she walked over and placed her parrots in with them.   After just a couple of seconds, the female parrots exclaimed out in unison, ""Hi, we're prostitutes. Do you want to have some fun?""   There was a stunned silence. Finally, one male parrot looked over at the other male parrot and said, ""Put the beads away, Francis, our prayers have been answered!""  ---  One fine day in Ireland, a guy is out golfing and gets up to the 16th hole. He tees up and cranks one. Unfortunately, it goes into the woods on the side of the fairway.   He goes looking for his ball and comes across this little guy with this huge knot on his head, and the golf ball lying right beside him. ""Goodness,"" says the golfer, and proceeds to revive the poor little guy.   Upon awaking, the little guy says, ""Well, you caught me fair and square. I am a leprechaun. I will grant you three wishes.""   The man says, ""I can't take anything from you, I""m just glad I didn""t hurt you too badly,"" and walks away.

I'll give him unlimited money, a great golf game, and a great sex life.""   Well, a year goes past (as they often do in jokes like this) and the same golfer is out golfing on the same course at the 16th hole. He gets up and hits one into the same woods and goes off looking for his ball. When he finds the ball he sees the same little guy and asks how he is doing.   The leprechaun says, ""I'm fine, and might I ask how your golf game is?""   The golfer says, ""It's great! I hit under par every time.""   The leprechaun says, ""I did that for you. And might I ask how your money is holding out?""   The golfer says, ""Well, now that you mention it, every time I put my hand in my pocket, I pull out a ten pound note.""   The leprechaun smiles and says, ""I did that for you. And might I ask how your sex life is?""   The golfer looks at him a little shyly and says, ""Well, maybe once or twice a week.""   The leprechaun is floored and stammers, ""Once or twice a week?!""   The golfer, a little embarrassed, looks at him and says, ""Well, that's not too bad for a Catholic priest in a small parish.""  ---  Two lawyers walking through the woods spotted a vicious looking bear.

""There ain't no way they can catch a Corvette,"" he thought to himself and opened her up further. The needle hit 90, 100, 130 and finally 150 with the light still behind him.

Man: Is there a problem sir?   Officer #2: One of my officers told me that you have stolen this car and murdered the owner.   Man: Murdered the owner?   Officer #2: Yes, could you please open the boot of your car please.   The man opens the boot, revealing nothing but an empty boot.   Officer #2: Is this your car sir?   Man: Yes, here are the registration papers.   The officer is quite stunned.   Officer #2: One of my officers claims that you do not have a driving licence.   The man digs in his pocket revealing a wallet and hands it to the officer. The officer opens the wallet and examines the licence. He looks quite puzzled.

The Senator agreed but insisted the transaction be witnessed by two of his senior advisors. “Money matters can lead to serious misunderstandings.” said Senator. ”It is always wise to have two witnesses.”   The Governor saw the wisdom of the advice. The cash was handed over to the Senator in the presence of two of his senior advisors.   Some weeks later when the Governor returned home, he called on the Senator and asked for the return of his money.   “What money?” asked the Senator. “I don’t know what you are talking about.”   “The cash I left with you.” pleaded the Governor. “You even had two of your senior advisors as witnesses.”   “Let’s ask them.” replied the Senator. The senior advisors were called to the Senator’s office.   “Do you know anything about this Governor leaving money with me?” asked the Senator.   “No sir, I know nothing” replied one. “No sir, he didn’t leave any money with you.” said the other. The senior advisors left the room. The Senator opened his safe and gave the Governor his cash.   “Why did you first say you knew nothing about my money”? Asked the bewildered Governor.   “I just wanted to know what kind of senior advisors I have. “ Replied the Senator. "

While he's in there, the husband tells his wife:  ""Listen, this guy's an escaped convict, look at his clothes! He probably spent lots of time in jail and hasn't seen a woman in years.

0,"Anger Management I was sitting at my desk when I remembered a phone call I'd forgotten to make.   I found the number and dialed it.   A man answered, saying 'Hello.'   I politely said,  'This is Chris. Could I please speak with Robyn Carter?'   Suddenly a manic voice yelled out in my ear  'Get the right f***ing number!'  And the phone was slammed down on me.   I couldn't believe that anyone could be so rude.   When I tracked down Robyn's correct number to call her,  I found that I had accidentally transposed the last two digits.   After hanging up with her, I decided to call the 'wrong' number again.   When the same guy answered the phone, I yelled 'You're an asshole!'  And hung up.   I wrote his number down with the word 'asshole' next to it,  And put it in my desk drawer.   Every couple of weeks, when I was paying bills or had a really bad day,  I'd call him up and yell, 'You're an asshole!'   It always cheered me up.   When Caller ID was introduced, I thought my therapeutic 'asshole' calling would have to stop.   So, I called his number and said, 'Hi, this is John Smith from the telephone company.  I'm calling to see if you're familiar with our Caller ID Program?'   He yelled 'NO!' And slammed down the phone.   I quickly called him back and said, 'That's because you're an asshole!'  And hung up.   One day I was at the store, getting ready to pull into a parking spot.   Some guy in a black BMW cut me off and pulled into the spot I had patiently waited for.   I hit the horn and yelled that I'd been waiting for that spot, but the idiot ignored me.   I noticed a 'For Sale' sign in his back window, so I wrote down his number.   A couple of days later, right after calling the first asshole (I had his number on speed dial)  I thought that I'd better call the BMW asshole, too.   I said, 'Is this the man with the black BMW for sale?'   He said, 'Yes, it is.'   I then asked, 'Can you tell me where I can see it?'   He said, 'Yes, I live at 34 Oaktree Blvd. , in Fairfax  It's a yellow ranch style house And the car's parked right out in front.'   I asked, 'What's your name?'   He said, 'My name is Don Hansen.'   I asked, 'When's a good time to catch you, Don?'   He said, 'I'm home every evening after five.'   I said, 'Listen, Don, can I tell you something?'   He said, 'Yes?'   I said, 'Don, you're an asshole!'   Then I hung up, and added his number to my speed dial, too.   Now, when I had a problem, I had two assholes to call.   Then I came up with an idea...   I called asshole #1.   He said, 'Hello'   I said, 'You're an asshole!'  (But I didn't hang up.)   He asked, 'Are you still there?'   I said, 'Yeah!'   He screamed, 'Stop calling me'   I said, 'Make me.'   He asked, 'Who are you?'   I said, 'My name is Don Hansen.'   He said, 'Yeah? Where do you live?'   I said, 'Asshole, I live at 34 Oaktree Blvd., in Fairfax, a yellow ranch style home and I have a black Beamer parked in front.'   He said, 'I'm coming over right now, Don.  And you had better start saying your prayers.'   I said, 'Yeah, like I'm really scared, asshole,' and hung up.   Then I called Asshole #2.   He said, 'Hello?'   I said, 'Hello, asshole,'   He yelled, 'If I ever find out who you are...'   I said, 'You'll what?'   He exclaimed, 'I'll kick your ass'   I answered, 'Well, asshole, here's your chance.  I'm coming over right now.'   Then I hung up and immediately called the police, saying that I was on my way over to 34 Oaktree Blvd, in Fairfax, to kill my gay lover.   Then I called Channel 7 News about the gang war going down in Oaktree Blvd in Fairfax . I quickly got into my car and headed over to Fairfax .   I got there just in time to watch two assholes beating the crap out of each other in front of six cop cars, an overhead news helicopter and surrounded by a news crew.   NOW I feel much better.

The boss says, ""I got about 50-60 yards away, and I could tell that the two women were my wife and my mistress.""  The subordinate says, ""We ain't got all day.  Let me go talk with them.""  So he drives up, gets about 50 yards away, and abruptly turns around.  When he gets back to the tee, he says, ""Unbelievable.  What a fucking coincidence."""
